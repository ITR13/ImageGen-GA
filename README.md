# ImageGen-GA
Uses circles to recreate an image given as "input.png", then outputting in the folder "output"
See it in action here: https://youtu.be/19cRyUqwoFo (sped up)

It can't move already placed circles, as it focuses at only one circle at the time.
This means that it won't be as good at recreating circles behind other circles, as it could be, but it shouldn't be much of an issue in the long run

The code is a tad bit messy, as it's my first try at using gago: https://github.com/MaxHalford/gago
